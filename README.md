Tested on Ubuntu and Python 3

A simple fork of 1n0r1's Monster Siren Records Downloader. Modified by me to convert into MP3's, and only single albums at a time. (My car doesn't let me play WAV audio files)

A simple script to download all your favorite Arknights OSTs from monster-siren.hypergryph.com

Download specific songs, albums and fill out metadata, album, cover art, artists (no lyrics because who needs those?)

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Runs:

Make sure that you installed ffmpeg and can run `ffmpeg` in your terminal.
